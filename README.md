## Introduction

Traditional investing has primarily been done through an allocation of risky assets (e.g. stocks and ETFs), and relatively riskless assets (e.g. bonds and certificates of deposit). Today, historically low interest rates are the norm, and a significant amount of debt today is issued with negative nominal interest rates. Even in the US, government-issued treasuries are being offered with yields below inflation. With stock markets near all-time highs amidst an ongoing trade war and slowing global growth, it can be difficult to justify an investment in the stock market in the medium term. Fortunately for the more risk-averse investor, alternative forms of investment have emerged through companies such as LendingClub, a fintech firm that provides a platform for peer-to-peer lending and is among the largest in this space.

We tackle two problems of interest. 

1. Predict bad loans, i.e. loans that are in default or charged-off. This is a classic problem which banks usually tackle to minimize losses. 
2. Optimize the investor's portfolio for maximum returns.

Loans on LendingClub are rated based on their interest rates, though it is expected that a higher percentage of these "subprime" loans with higher rates eventually default and/or are charged-off, resulting in a loss for the investor. Hence a balance must be made between risk and reward.
